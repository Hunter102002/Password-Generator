# Password Generator

## Objective

The project aimed to develop a simple password generator using Python that can create strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria. The goal was to practice Python programming skills, particularly in randomization, string manipulation, and user input handling.

### Skills Learned

- Python Programming: Writing and executing Python scripts.
- Randomization: Using the random module to generate random characters.
- String Manipulation: Concatenating and shuffling strings to form a password.
- User Input Handling: Reading and processing user inputs to customize the password generation.
- Basic Program Flow: Structuring a program to generate and display a password based on user inputs.

### Tools Used

- Python: The primary programming language used for developing the quiz.
- PyCharm: An integrated development environment (IDE) used for writing, running, and debugging the quiz script.

### Outcome
This project successfully demonstrated the ability to create a simple password generator using Python. The generator could create strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria, showcasing fundamental skills in Python programming, randomization, and user interaction handling.
